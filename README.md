## Abstract
 Optical coherence tomography angiography(OCTA) is a non-invasive imaging modality that can acquire high-resolution volumes of the retinal vasculature and aid the diagnosis of ocular, neurological and cardiac diseases. Segmenting the visible blood vessels is a common first step when extracting quantitative biomarkers from these images. Classical segmentation algorithms based on thresholding are strongly affected by image artifacts and limited signal-to-noise ratio. The use of modern, deep learning-based segmentation methods has been inhibited by a lack of large datasets with detailed annotations of the blood vessels. To address this issue, recent work has employed transfer learning, where a segmentation network is trained on synthetic OCTA images and is then applied to real data. However, the previously proposed simulations fail to faithfully model the retinal vasculature and do not provide effective domain adaptation. Because of this, current methods are unable to fully segment the retinal vasculature, in particular the smallest capillaries. In this work, we present a lightweight simulation of the retinal vascular network based on space colonization for faster and more realistic OCTA synthesis. We then introduce three contrast adaptation pipelines to decrease the domain gap between real and artificial images. We demonstrate the superior segmentation performance of our approach in extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on three public datasets that compare our method to traditional computer vision algorithms and supervised training using human annotations. Finally, we make our entire pipeline publicly available, including the source code, pretrained models, and a large dataset of synthetic OCTA images

# ðŸ”´ TL;DR: Segment my images / Generate synthetic images
We provide a docker file with a pretrained model to segment 3Ã—3 mmÂ² macular OCTA images:
```sh
# Build Docker image. (Only required once)
docker build . -t octa-seg
``` 
#### 1. To **segment** a set of images, replace the placeholders with your directory paths and run:
> [!NOTE]
> If you are using Windows and the following commands fail, make sure to change the end of line sequence of the `./docker/dockershell.sh` file from `CRLF` to `LF` (unix style).
```sh
docker run --rm -v [DATASET_DIR]:/var/dataset -v [RESULT_DIR]:/var/segmented octa-seg segmentation
``` 
#### 2. **We provide 500 synthetic training samples** with labels under [./datasets](./datasets). To **generate** _N_ more samples, run:
```sh
docker run --rm -v [RESULT_DIR]:/var/generation octa-seg generation [N]
```

# ðŸ”µ Manual Installation
The project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) with a `pyproject.toml` (`requirements.txt` is depricated). Follow these steps to set up a local environment.

### Prerequisites
- OS: Linux recommended (Docker instructions above also available)
- Python: 3.13 (declared in `pyproject.toml`)
- GPU (optional but recommended): NVIDIA driver compatible with CUDA 12.6 for GPU builds of PyTorch (cu126)

> Note
> If your system Python isnâ€™t 3.13, uv can manage a local Python for this project.

### 1) Install uv
- Linux quick install (official script):
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Ensure uv is on PATH (if needed)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
uv --version
```

### 2) Create the virtual environment and install deps
From the repository root:
```sh
uv sync --no-dev
```
This will:
- Create a project-local virtual environment at `.venv`
- Install all dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`
- Use the configured extra index for PyTorch cu126 wheels when available

Activate the environment (optional if you prefer `uv run`):
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3) Verify PyTorch/CUDA
You can quickly check whether CUDA is detected:
```sh
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.version.cuda)"
```
Expected: `torch.cuda.is_available()` is `True` on a properly configured CUDA system; otherwise it will fall back to CPU.

### 4) Running commands
You can either stay in the activated venv and use `python`, or prefix commands with `uv run` without activating:
- Example (train):
```sh
uv run python train.py --config_file ./configs/[CONFIG_FILE_NAME]
```

> Troubleshooting
> - If you have older NVIDIA drivers (pre CUDA 12.6), prefer the Docker-based workflow above or adjust your local PyTorch/CUDA setup accordingly.
> - Some optional packages like `open3d` may not yet provide wheels for Python 3.13. They are intentionally excluded/commented in `pyproject.toml`.


### Synthetic Dataset
We provide 500 synthetic training samples with labels under [./datasets](./datasets). To **create more samples**, visit the respective [README](./datasets/README.md).

### Getting the evaluation datasets 

We use three test datasets:
 - [OCTA-500](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/octa-500) (Mingchao Li, Yerui Chen, Songtao Yuan, Qiang Chen, December 23, 2019, "OCTA-500", IEEE Dataport, doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2020.2992244.)
 - [ROSE-1](https://imed.nimte.ac.cn/dataofrose.html) (Ma, Yuhui; Hao, Huaying; Xie, Jianyang; Fu, Huazhu; Zhang, Jiong; Yang, Jianlong et al. (2021): ROSE: A Retinal OCT-Angiography Vessel Segmentation Dataset and New Model. In IEEE transactions on medical imaging 40 (3), pp.Â 928â€“939. https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2020.3042802.)
 - [Giarratano <i>et al.</i>](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3528) (Giarratano, Ylenia. (2019). Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography retinal scans and segmentations. University of Edinburgh. Medical School. https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/2729. )


> [!IMPORTANT]
> - For the OCTA-500 dataset, make sure to select the correct images and not to include the FAZ segmentation.
> - Each dataset comes with a different level of detail for vessel segmentation. When training on synthetic data, make sure to select the correct min_radius in the repective [config.yml](configs/config_ves_seg-S.yml#L37) for label alignment.
> - When training on synthetic data for the dataset by Giarratano <i>et al.</i>, you have to apply random cropping in the training data augmentations of the [config.yml](configs/config_ves_seg-S.yml#L79) file.

### Getting the pretrained models
We provide a pretrained GAN model and segmentation model trained for the OCTA-500 dataset under  `./docker/trained_models`.


# ðŸŸ¡ How to use repository
## Examples
We provide two jupyter notebooks with a step-by-step explanation on how to use this repository.
1. [example_custom_vessel_simulation.ipynb](./example_custom_vessel_simulation.ipynb) shows how you can customize the vessel simulation to your needs. We create a toy configuration that simulates 12x12 mmÂ² OCTA images.
2. [example_train_gan-seg_with_new_dataset.ipynb](./example_train_gan-seg_with_new_dataset.ipynb) explains how you can train a new GAN and segmentation model tailored to your own dataset. This will boost segmentation performance notably if your dataset has a different contrast that the OCTA-500 dataset. 

## ROI Cropping
We provide a utility script to crop regions of interest (ROI) from OCTA images. The script automatically detects the ROI location and crops images to a specified size, with intelligent handling of directory structures:

```sh
python ROI_cropping.py --input_dir [INPUT_DIRECTORY] --output_dir [OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] --roi_size [ROI_SIZE]
```

## General info
Experiments are organized via config.yml files. We provide several predefined config files under `./configs` for the experiments shown in the paper. Please refer to the respective [README](configs/README.md) for more information.

## GAN training
To re-train a GAN model for the S-GAN experiment in the paper, you can use the provided [config file](./configs/config_gan_ves_seg.yml). The trained Generator is then used for data augmentation when training a separate segmentation network on synthetic data (see [config file](./configs/config_ves_seg-S_GAN.yml)).

```sh
# Train a new Generator network
python train.py --config_file ./configs/config_gan_ves_seg.yml 
```
Now manually copy the path of the generator checkpoint to [./configs/config_ves_seg-S_GAN.yml](./configs/config_ves_seg-S_GAN.yml).
```yml
Train:
    data_augmentation:
        #...
        - name: ImageToImageTranslationd
            model_path: ./results/gan-ves-seg/[FOLDER_NAME]/checkpoints/
```

## Segmentation training
To train models for experiments as shown in the paper, you can use the provided config files under `./configs`. Select the required dataset by specifying the input path in the respective config file. After the training has started, a new folder will be created. The folder contains training details, checkpoints, and a 'config.yml' file that you will need for validation and testing.
```sh
# Start a new training instance
python train.py --config_file ./configs/[CONFIG_FILE_NAME]
```

## Validation
To evaluate trained models (or methods that do not need to be trained), make sure the validation section of the respective config file is correct and run:
```sh
python validate.py --config_file [PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE] --epoch [EPOCH]
```

## Testing / Inference
To generate segmentations (or transformed images if testing GAN), make sure the test section of the respective config file is correct and run:
```sh
python test.py --config_file [PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE] --epoch [EPOCH]
```
